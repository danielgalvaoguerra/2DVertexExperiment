Processing (.pde) program

Experiment manipulating rectangle vertices in 2D with hopes of expanding it into a 3D version.

Plan of action:
  - Get right and left edges working
  - Add outlines showing clickable area on edges and work on not allowing overlap
  - Change edge color when mouse rolls over to show it can be pulled/pushed and add new edge position preview
  - Make each of the four edges work by distinguishing between vertical and horizontal cases
  - Add option to move entire rectangle (either by button and mouse combination or by clicking center of rectangle)
