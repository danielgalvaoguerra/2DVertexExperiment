Processing (.pde) program

Experiment manipulating rectangle vertices in 2D with hopes of expanding it into a 3D version.

Plan of action:
  - Get right and left edges working (working)
  - Add outlines showing clickable area on edges and work on not allowing overlap (Edit: did not look good, will only be used for testing purposes)
  - Edit: changed mechanics so edge follows mouse position instead of moving only when mouse is released
  - Change edge color when mouse rolls over to show which edge will be pulled/pushed and <strike>add new edge position preview</strike>(not nessesary after above edit) (working)
  - Make each of the four edges work by distinguishing between vertical and horizontal cases
  - Add option to move entire rectangle (either by button and mouse combination or by clicking center of rectangle)
